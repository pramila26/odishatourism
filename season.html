						October to March (Winter) is the best time to visit Odisha. During these months the sky remains clear, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. The famous Konark Dance festival takes place in February, making it all the more exciting to visit the state. The state enjoys a tropical monsoon climate throughout the year because of its proximity to the sea; hence, there are incessant rains during the Monsoon season from July to September. Summers from April to June are quite hot with occasional rainfalls making it quite uncomfortable for sightseeing. Hence it's advised to plan your trip accordingly.
